## The Systeminformation Project
This is amazing. Started as a small project just for myself, it now has > 15,000 lines of code, > 600 versions published, up to 6 mio downloads per month, > 150 mio downloads overall. #1 NPM ranking for backend packages. Thank you to all who contributed to this project!

## Please support this project ... ☕️

Over the past few years I spent **over 2.000 hours** working on this project and invested in hardware to be able to test on different platforms. Currently I am working very hard on the next **new version 6.0** completely rewritten in TypeScript and with a lot of new features. Any support is highly appreciated - [Buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/systeminfo).

**Your contribution** make it possible for me to keep working on this project, add new features and support more platforms. Thank you in advance!

## New Version 5.0

The new Version 5 is here - this next major version release 5.0 comes with new functionality and several improvements and changes (some of them are breaking changes!):

- added audio: get detailed audio device information
- added bluetooth: get detailed bluetooth device information
- added dockerImages, dockerVolumes: get detailed information about docker images and volumes
- added printer: get information from detected printers
- added usb: get detailed usb controller and device information
- added wifi interfaces and connections: extended wifi information
- better uuid function to get unique hardware and OS UUIDs
- better/extended cpu info detection
- better/extended system info detection
- Apple Silicon M1 support
- better Raspberry-PI detection
- systeminformation website updated and extended with full documentation and examples [systeminformation.io][systeminformation-url]
- lot of minor improvements

Breaking Changes in version 5: you will see several breaking changes for the sake of a more consistent API interface and to be future proof. Read the [detailed version 5 changes][changes5-url].

I did a lot of testing on different platforms and machines but of course there might be some issues that I am not aware of. I would be happy if you inform me when you discover any issues. Issues can be [opened here][new-issue].

## Quick Start

Lightweight collection of 50+ functions to retrieve detailed hardware, system and OS information.

- simple to use
- get detailed information about system, cpu, baseboard, battery, memory, disks/filesystem, network, docker, software, services and processes
- supports Linux, macOS, partial Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS and Android support
- no npm dependencies

**Attention**: this is a `node.js` library. It is supposed to be used as a backend/server-side library and will definitely not work within a browser.

### Installation

```bash
npm install systeminformation --save
```

or simpler

```bash
npm i systeminformation
```

### Give it a try with `npx`?

You just want to give it a try - right from your command line without installing it? Here is how you can call it with `npx`:

```
# get basic system info (System, OS, CPU)
npx systeminformation info

# obtain all static data - may take up to 30 seconds
npx systeminformation
```


#### Still need Version 4?

If you need version 4 (for compatibility reasons), you can install version 4 (latest release) like this

```bash
npm install systeminformation@4 —save
```

or simpler

```bash
npm install systeminformation@4
```

### Usage

All functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous functions. Here a small example how to use them:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

// promises style - new since version 3
si.cpu()
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

## Core concept

[Node.js][nodejs-url] comes with some basic OS information, but I always wanted a little more. So I came up to write this little library. This library is still a work in progress. It is supposed to be used as a backend/server-side library (it will definitely not work within a browser). It requires node.js version 4.0 and above.

I was able to test it on several Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu distributions as well as macOS (Mavericks, Yosemite, El Captain, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur) and some Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and SunOS machines. Not all functions are supported on all operating systems. Have a look at the function reference in the docs to get further details.

If you have comments, suggestions & reports, please feel free to contact me!


I also created a nice little command line tool called [mmon][mmon-github-url] (micro-monitor) for Linux and macOS, also available via [github][mmon-github-url] and [npm][mmon-npm-url]

### cb: Asynchronous Function Calls (callback)

Remember: all functions (except `version` and `time`) are implemented as asynchronous functions! There are now three ways to consume them:

**Callback Style**

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

si.cpu(function(data) {
  console.log('CPU Information:');
  console.log('- manufacturer: ' + data.manufacturer);
  console.log('- brand: ' + data.brand);
  console.log('- speed: ' + data.speed);
  console.log('- cores: ' + data.cores);
  console.log('- physical cores: ' + data.physicalCores);
  console.log('...');
})
```

### Promises

**Promises Style** is new in version 3.0.

When omitting callback parameter (cb), then you can use all function in a promise oriented way. All functions (except of `version` and `time`) are returning a promise, that you can consume:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

si.cpu()
  .then(data => {
    console.log('CPU Information:');
    console.log('- manufacturer: ' + data.manufacturer);
    console.log('- brand: ' + data.brand);
    console.log('- speed: ' + data.speed);
    console.log('- cores: ' + data.cores);
    console.log('- physical cores: ' + data.physicalCores);
    console.log('...');
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

### Async / Await

**Using async / await** (available since node v7.6)

Since node v7.6 you can also use the `async` / `await` pattern. The above example would then look like this:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

async function cpuData() {
  try {
    const data = await si.cpu();
    console.log('CPU Information:');
    console.log('- manufacturer: ' + data.manufacturer);
    console.log('- brand: ' + data.brand);
    console.log('- speed: ' + data.speed);
    console.log('- cores: ' + data.cores);
    console.log('- physical cores: ' + data.physicalCores);
    console.log('...');
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
  }
}
```

## Known Issues

#### macOS - Temperature Sensor

To be able to measure temperature on macOS I created a little additional package. Due to some difficulties
in NPM with `optionalDependencies` I unfortunately was getting unexpected warnings on other platforms.
So I decided to drop this optional dependency for macOS - so by default, you will not get correct values.

This additional package is now also supporting Apple Silicon M1 machines.

But if you need to detect macOS temperature just run the following additional
installation command:

```bash
$ npm install osx-temperature-sensor --save
```

`systeminformation` will then detect this additional library and return the temperature when calling systeminformations standard function `cpuTemperature()`

#### Windows Temperature, Battery, ...

`get-WmiObject` - which is used to determine temperature and battery sometimes needs to be run with admin
privileges. So if you do not get any values, try to run it again with according
privileges. If you still do not get any values, your system might not support this feature.
In some cases we also discovered that `get-WmiObject` returned incorrect temperature values.

#### Linux Temperature

In some cases you need to install the Linux `sensors` package to be able to measure temperature
e.g. on DEBIAN based systems by running `sudo apt-get install lm-sensors`

#### Linux S.M.A.R.T. Status

To be able to detect S.M.A.R.T. status on Linux you need to install `smartmontools`. On DEBIAN based Linux distributions you can install it by running `sudo apt-get install smartmontools`

#### Windows Encoding Issues
I now reimplemented all windows functions to avoid encoding problems (special chacarters). And as Windows 11 now dropped `wmic` support, I had to move completely to `powershell`. Be sure that powershell version 5+ is installed on your machine. On older Windows versions (7, 8) you might still see encoding problems due to the old powershell version.
## *: Additional Notes

In `fsStats()`, `disksIO()` and `networkStats()` the results / sec. values (rx_sec, IOPS, ...) are calculated correctly beginning
with the second call of the function. It is determined by calculating the difference of transferred bytes / IOs
divided by the time between two calls of the function.

The first time you are calling one of these functions, you will get `null` for transfer rates. The second time, you should then get statistics based on the time between the two calls ...

So basically, if you e.g. need a value for network stats every second, your code should look like this:

```js
const si = require('systeminformation');

setInterval(function() {
  si.networkStats().then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
}, 1000)
```

Beginning with the second call, you get network transfer values per second.
