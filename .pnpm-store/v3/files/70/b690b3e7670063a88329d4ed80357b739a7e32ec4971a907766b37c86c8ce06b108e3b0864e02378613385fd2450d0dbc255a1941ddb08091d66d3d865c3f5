## Install

```
$ npm install pino
```

If you would like to install pino v6, refer to https://github.com/pinojs/pino/tree/v6.x.

## Usage

```js
const logger = require('pino')()

logger.info('hello world')

const child = logger.child({ a: 'property' })
child.info('hello child!')
```

This produces:

```
{"level":30,"time":1531171074631,"msg":"hello world","pid":657,"hostname":"Davids-MBP-3.fritz.box"}
{"level":30,"time":1531171082399,"msg":"hello child!","pid":657,"hostname":"Davids-MBP-3.fritz.box","a":"property"}
```

## Essentials

### Development Formatting

The [`pino-pretty`](https://github.com/pinojs/pino-pretty) module can be used to
format logs during development:

### Transports & Log Processing

Due to Node's single-threaded event-loop, it's highly recommended that sending,
alert triggering, reformatting and all forms of log processing
be conducted in a separate process or thread.

In Pino terminology we call all log processors "transports", and recommend that the
transports be run in a worker thread using our `pino.transport` API.

For more details see our [Transports⇗](docs/transports.md) document.

### Low overhead

Using minimum resources for logging is very important. Log messages
tend to get added over time and this can lead to a throttling effect
on applications – such as reduced requests per second.

In many cases, Pino is over 5x faster than alternatives.

See the [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) document for comparisons.

### Bundling support

Pino supports to being bundled using tools like webpack or esbuild. 

See [Bundling](docs/bundling.md) document for more informations.
